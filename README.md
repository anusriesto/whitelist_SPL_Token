# whitelist_SPL_Token
Develop a Solana smart contract using Rust or Anchor framework to implement a token distribution system. This system allows the contract owner to fund the contract with a specific SPL token and set up an airdrop mechanism for whitelisted addresses. Each whitelisted address is entitled to claim a pre-defined quantity of the SPL token.
